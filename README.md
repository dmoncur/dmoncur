- 👋 Hi, I’m @dmoncur
- 👀 I’m interested in code snippets and examples in different languages
- Things you don't see in the documentation or examples of key methods and properties.
- 🌱 I’m currently using Visual Basic and have used many other languages. Need to sharpen
- my skils in C# as that is where Microsoft is going.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the above
- 📫 How to reach me: email: dmoncur@gmail.com
